Train Game ðŸš‚â„¢ is a very simple game.

Everyone starts with the same number of cards, your goal is to get
all other players to run out of cards and go bankrupt, and you win.

You have only 3 buttons:
- When it's your turn, you must "put a card" to the end of the Train ðŸš‚â„¢.
- If the newest card has the same value as one of the other cards in
  the Train ðŸš‚â„¢, you can "call a claim" to get all the cards in 
  between (inclusive).
- If a player forgets to claim in their round, another player can
  claim the cards instead.
- "Pass" to the next player if you're done with your round. (In this
  case, the Bot ðŸ¤–â„¢.)

* This game is actually winnable. It just takes time especially when
  a player only has a few cards left.

It's a childhood card game and is the one I liked the most out of the
many other modes I was taught. However, this is just a rough mock-up
of the original game. I forgot the exact rules and details, and made
up the name too. This is much more fun played with more people IRL.
